# Issue Closure Gate (Investigator Required)

Before closing any implementation issue:

1. Request investigator review.
2. Investigator must return one of:
   - `READY_TO_CLOSE`
   - `NOT_READY`
3. If `NOT_READY`, keep issue open and attach gap list.
4. Closure requires evidence links:
   - commit/PR
   - tests executed
   - docs updated (or explicit docs follow-up issue)

This gate applies to issues #1-#9 and future implementation issues.
